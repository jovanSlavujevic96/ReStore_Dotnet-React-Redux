use vite (veet) to create react project by following:
1. `$ npm create vite@latest`
2. `y` to proceed
3. give project name
4. select a framework (React)
5. select a variant (TypeScript + SWC) - SWC is just a little bit faster, nothing else to compare

to update react (i.e. to v19): \
`$ npm install react@19 react-dom@19`

to run react: \
`$ npm run dev`
